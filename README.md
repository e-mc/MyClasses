# MyClasses
My own implementations of Java classes like Matrix, Sequence, etc

Element.java : 
Element is an abstract class inherited by MyChar and MyInt

Map.java : 
Map contains a key-value Pair and a pointer to the next Map in a sequence of Maps. It also contains methods
to access or mutate the Map objects in various ways. 

MapIterator.java : 
MapIterator holds a Map object that can point to Maps in a sequence of Maps.

MyChar.java : 
MyChar class hold the value of a char and includes functions to access or mutate that char.

MyInteger.java :
MyInteger class hold the value of an int and includes functions to access or mutate that int.

Matrix.java : 
Matrix can print, add, create, and multiply matrices.

Sequence.java :
Sequence class will hold an Element and a point to the next Sequence.
According to the calls in the test files, sequence acts as a listnode as opposed
to a container for a head listnode, which would then lead to others.

SequenceIterator.java :
SequenceIterator class creates a sequence pointer and provides methods to advance or 
return data as this pointer traverses a given list of sequences.

Pair.java :
The Pair class contains a character, key, and methods to get, set, or access them.
